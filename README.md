# Adaptive Pricing System using Reinforcement Learning

> A dynamic pricing solution that leverages Reinforcement Learning to maximize revenue in e-commerce environments by adapting to market uncertainty

## Overview

In today's dynamic e-commerce market, pricing decisions are often made under uncertainty. Traditional pricing strategies rely on static or rule-based models, which fail to adapt to rapidly changing factors such as seasonality, competitor pricing, and customer preferences.

This project aims to develop a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Adaptive Pricing System** that dynamically adjusts product prices to maximize revenue, balance exploration and exploitation, and provide valuable business insights.

## Problem Statement

Most academic research assumes that the demand function (relationship between price and demand) is known to the decision-maker. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption rarely holds true.

### Uncertainty arises due to:

- Seasonality and time-based trends
- Competitor price changes
- Consumer behavior and preferences
- External factors or market fluctuations

### Challenges:

- **Under-pricing** → Loss of potential revenue
- **Overpricing** → Reduced customer acquisition
- **Manual adjustments** → Not scalable in real-time environments

Hence, there is a need for a robust, scalable, and adaptive system that learns pricing strategies directly from data.

## Objectives

### Main Objective

To design and implement an Adaptive Pricing System using Reinforcement Learning (RL) that maximizes cumulative revenue in an e-commerce environment.

### Specific Objectives

1. **Develop a Pricing Model**: Formulate the pricing task as a sequential decision-making problem and implement Q-Learning and DQN algorithms for price optimization.

2. **Model Demand Behaviour**: Learn demand elasticity and purchasing patterns from data for dynamic price adjustments.

3. **Balance Exploration & Exploitation**: Use ε-greedy strategy and price constraints to explore pricing possibilities safely.

4. **Ensure Scalability**: Build an API-based, containerized architecture that supports real-time decision-making.

5. **Evaluate Performance**: Compare the RL-based model with traditional static and rule-based pricing methods.

6. **Provide Business Insights**: Analyze learned pricing policies to uncover consumer price sensitivity and optimal price ranges.

## Methodology

### Problem Formulation (MDP Setup)

- **State (S)**: Demand level, time, competitor price, seasonality
- **Action (A)**: Possible price points
- **Reward (R)**: Revenue = Price × Quantity Sold

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Use public datasets like [Kaggle's Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering (time-based features, rolling averages, competitor simulation)

### Environment Simulation

- Build a custom RL environment inspired by OpenAI Gym
- Simulate demand with random noise for realistic behavior

### Model Development

- **Phase 1**: Implement tabular Q-Learning with ε-greedy exploration
- **Phase 2**: Extend to Deep Q-Network (DQN) using PyTorch for larger state spaces

### Training & Testing

- Train agents across episodes until convergence
- Evaluate on unseen demand patterns

### Performance Evaluation

Compare RL models with:
- Static Pricing
- Rule-Based Pricing

**Metrics**: Revenue, regret, and price stability

### Deployment & Visualization

- Build REST API using FastAPI/Flask
- Create Streamlit Dashboard for visualization (price trends, revenue, demand elasticity)
- Containerize using Docker
